Mapping the Risks for Architectures is a Useful Next Step](https://intarchboard.github.io/draft-iab-agews-report/draft-iab-agews-report.html#section-3.6) \r\n\r\n> Some participants noted that certain architectural approaches may carry higher path-dependence risk than others once widely deployed, even if they remain theoretically possible to withdraw or replace. This risk can arise from accumulated architectural dependencies, operational integration with third-party services, and evolving expectations among users and service providers. As a result, architectures that tightly couple functionality to external verification services or embed assumptions about routine age signalling may increase the practical cost of transition, should alternative approaches later emerge that address privacy, equity, or effectiveness concerns more effectively.\r\n\r\n@martinthomson @mnot ",

Because norms constantly change I don't think they ever qualify as one-way doors.\n\nSimilarly, I don't think that age assurance providers naturally become entrenched once they are in place.  They might prefer that outcome, and might even work toward creating a dependency on aspects of their service. Ultimately, they provide a service in exchange for money.  If the need for the service evaporates, I can't see any provider having trouble deciding to end the contract.  More so if the services are as costly as it seems they are.",
