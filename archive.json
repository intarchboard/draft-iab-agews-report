Because norms constantly change I don't think they ever qualify as one-way doors.\n\nSimilarly, I don't think that age assurance providers naturally become entrenched once they are in place.  They might prefer that outcome, and might even work toward creating a dependency on aspects of their service. Ultimately, they provide a service in exchange for money.  If the need for the service evaporates, I can't see any provider having trouble deciding to end the contract.  More so if the services are as costly as it seems they are.",
